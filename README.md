# Github Developer Dynamics
### Analyzing Token Price Correlations
#### Ocean Protocol Data Challenge #6 2024
This repo aims to asses influence to price on several AI crypto projects through using the developers activity data from github accounts. 

First of all correlations showcase a negative to non correlation between the development activity and the price of a token. 

Social media activity is much more correlated to the price of a token than the development activity itself. The *Buy the rumor, Sell the news* effect shows up since there are a lot of rumors going on Social Media. Specifically, data from Reddit has been used. The analysis could be enhanced with data from X. 

Every project showcase a differences on development activity, but in the last couple weeks and months there are 3 projects which are outstanding on development: 
- FetchAI
- Ocean Protocol
- SingularityNET

The reason behind is mostly the announced merger into $ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence).
